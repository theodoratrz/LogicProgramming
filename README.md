# Logic Programming using Prolog

### Group A
The exercises of this group are implemented using the standard ECLiPSe-CLP Prolog predicates.

1. `RunLengthEncoding`: Encode and decode a sequence of symbols.
2. `Registers`: Move and Swap content between registers.
3. `Domino`: How to place dominos pieces to create a given board.

### Group B
The exercises of this group are all CSP-based problems, and are solved using the [`ic`](https://eclipseclp.org/doc/bips/lib/ic/index.html), [`ic_global`](https://eclipseclp.org/doc/bips/lib/ic_global/index.html) and [`branch_and_bound`](https://eclipseclp.org/doc/bips/lib/branch_and_bound/index.html) libraries provided by ECLiPSe-CLP.

All exercises are implemented in [ECLiPSe-CLP](https://eclipseclp.org/) Prolog.
